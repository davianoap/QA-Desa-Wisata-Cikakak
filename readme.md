## Manual

### Jira 
I learn Jira as the Bug Management Tools. What have I did before with Jira:

1. Desa Wisata Cikakak
The Cikakak Tourism Village website is a website that is used to digitize a place. It is a Cikakak tourist village, located in the Straits of Banyumas Regency. The attraction of this village itself is the Antap Tourism Market, the Saka Tunggal Mosque, and there are still many SMEs and art crafts there. This website aims to help people find information about and visit Cikakak village.

Desa Wista cikakak has a dynamic [website](https://desawisatacikakak.com/) which to me should have a little bit of touch and fixing to make it more better. I have written some bugs as issues at Jira and already report it to the developer.
